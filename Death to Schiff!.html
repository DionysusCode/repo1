    <p>
        I'm going to break it down quite simply.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Whether we Love or Hate the guy, we're all huge fans of Peter Schiff.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
    So, a charitable solution has been created, with 2 simple features.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
       
            Feature #1) a social counter will be providing total webpage clicks,
                <br><br>
                //Peter Schiff tweets, drawing Attention to Bitcoin â€” we answer by flooding his streams with this site, which leads us in to Feature #2...
                <br><br>
            Feature #2)
             <br><br>
                //a bitcoin payment hub is implemented below, facilitating donations to "The Water Project"; a solution for providing water to communities in sub-Saharan Africa who suffer needlessly from a lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation.

    <p> 
        There is only one reason Why this site exists. 
        <br><br>
        It exists because the interest for Bitcoin has never been greater, nor has the Love in the community ever been stronger.
        <br><br>

        As the network effect grows, as Attention is brought to the space, as Peter Schiff tweets;- a social solution has been set up, to capture that Flow, and convert it to Clean Water for the less fortunate.
